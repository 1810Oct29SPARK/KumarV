        <p>Many of the experiments done during Project MKUltra involved the use of LSD, a hallucinogenic drug. The chemist who headed MKUltra, Dr. Sidney Gottlieb (right), 
            believed that LSD could be used in covert operations. He thought that since the drug affected people only temporarily, it could be given to high ranking officials
        and affect their speeches and meetings. Since Dr. Gottlieb recognized that administering the drug in a laboratory setting would produce far different results
    than using it in secret operations, he began a set of experiments where many subjects were given the drug without their knowledge and therefore
    without their consent.

        Some of the people experimented on were prisoners or patients in mental institutions. CIA operatives would also experiment on each other; one person would administer the drug to the other
        person and record the results. As the experimentation progressed, people would be drugged randomly. Oftentimes the reactions to the drugs was adverse, with people hallucinating and becoming psychotic.
        When some of the subjects consented to be part of the experiment, they were subjected to even more extreme experiments. In one case, 7 volunteers in Kentucky were given LSD for 
        77 consecutive days. The experiments continued even after a death was attributed to them. Dr. Frank Olson was given LSD without his knowledge, became depressed, and committed suicide a week later. 
        The researchers at Project MKUltra later dismissed LSD as being too unpredictable of a drug. Millions of dollars were wasted and thousands of subjects were administered LSD only for the researchers to 
        finally realize that LSD could not be used in the way they wanted.
