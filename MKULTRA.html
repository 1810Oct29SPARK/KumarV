        <em><h3>About</h3></em>
        <p>
               In the 1950s, the Central Intelligence Agency began a secret mind control project called  <strong>MKUltra.</strong> During the Cold War,
               fear of communism was at its height. The CIA feared that American prisoners of war were being brainwashed by the Soviets, Chinese, and Koreans, during the Korean War. 
               The CIA wanted to develop similar mind control techniques to use on their own prisoners. 
        </p>
        <p>
                One of the methods of mind control that was studied was the use of LSD. CIA operatives would give the drug to prisoners, drug addicts, and mental-hospital patients. Additionally,
                some of the test subjects were other CIA agents and members of the general public. Many of the test subjects were not aware that they were being tested on and therefore did not consent
                to the tests, which was a direct violation of the Nuremburg Code. The experiments continued even after the death of Dr. Frank Olson,
                who was defenestrated and died after being secretly drugged with LSD.

        <p>
            In 1973, there was widespread panic in the government after the Watergate Scandal. Then CIA director Richard Helms ordered all of the documents relating to 
            Project MKUltra to be destroyed. 20,000 documents were incorrectly filed in a financial records building and were discovered after a FOIA request in 1977.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although many of the activities that took place during Project MKUltra were illegal, there were very few consequences. Because of the CIA's destruction of the majority
            of its records, the failure to follow informed consent procedures, and the uncontrolled nature of the experiments, the total impact of MKUltra will likely never be known.
